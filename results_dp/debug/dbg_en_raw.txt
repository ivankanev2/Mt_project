00339 | EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
00340 | The objective of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Standard No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards – General Safety Requirements is to provide safety requirements, instructions and guides on radiation protection and safety. All these activities result in improvement for safety in IAEA countries. Fulfilling these requirements ensure that all relevant measures for protection and safety from harmful effects of ionizing radiation has been made. These standards apply to facilities and activities that give rise to radiation risks, including nuclear installations, the use of radiation and radioactive sources, the transport of radioactive material and the management of radioactive waste. The IAEA safety standards reflect an international consensus on what constitutes a high level of safety for protecting people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation, because its effects may have global impact.
00341 | The objective of this particular publication is to establish the general safety requirements to be met during siting, design, manufacture, construction, assembly, commissioning, operation, maintenance and decommissioning.
00342 | The AP1000 plant design meets all design related IAEA GSR Part 3 with no identified non-compliances. The requirements are mostly applicable to operating facilities (including nuclear power plants) with Owner/Licensee/Government/Regulatory body responsibilities. Some of the requirements apply to medicine, aviation and aerospace which is why they are not applicable to AP1000 technology.
00343 | Table 1-1 in Section 1.4 provides a summary of the AP1000 plant compliance assessment to the IAEA Safety Standard No. GSR Part 3. The compliance categories are defined in Section 2.1. The detailed justification of compliance is provided in the identified Sections 2.2 – 2.5.
00344 | Introduction
00345 | Overview and purpose of document
00346 | Introduction to IAEA safety standards and related publications
00347 | Radioactivity is a natural phenomenon and natural sources of radiation are features of the environment. Radiation and radioactive substances have many beneficial applications, ranging from power generation to uses in medicine, industry and agriculture. The radiation risks to workers and the public and to the environment that may arise from these applications have to be assessed and, if necessary, controlled. Activities such as the medical uses of radiation, the operation of nuclear installations, the production, transport and use of radioactive material, and the management of radioactive waste must therefore be subject to standards of safety. Regulating safety is a national responsibility. However, radiation risks may transcend national borders, and international cooperation serves to promote and enhance safety globally by exchanging experience and by improving capabilities to control hazards, to prevent accidents, to respond to emergencies and to mitigate any harmful consequences. States have an obligation of diligence and duty of care, and are expected to fulfil their national and international undertakings and obligations [1].
00348 | The IAEA safety standards reflect an international consensus on what constitutes a high level of safety for protecting people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation. These Standards are based on ten safety principles stated in the original document. “The fundamental safety objective is to protect people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation.” This objective must be achieved without unduly limiting the operation of facilities or the conduct of activities that give rise to radiation risks. Therefore, the system of protection and safety aims to assess, manage and control exposure to radiation so that radiation risks, including risks of health effects and risks to the environment, are reduced to the extent reasonably achievable [1].
00349 | The principal users of safety standards in IAEA Member States are regulatory bodies and other relevant national authorities. The IAEA safety standards are also used by co-sponsoring organizations and by many organizations that design, construct and operate nuclear facilities, as well as organizations involved in the use of radiation and radioactive sources. The IAEA safety standards are applicable, as relevant, throughout the entire lifetime of all facilities and activities — existing and new — utilized for peaceful purposes and to protective actions to reduce existing radiation risks. They can be used by States as a reference for their national regulations in respect of facilities and activities.
00350 | With a view to ensuring the protection of people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation, the IAEA safety standards establish fundamental safety principles, requirements and measures to control the radiation exposure of people and the release of radioactive material to the environment, to restrict the likelihood of events that might lead to a loss of control over a nuclear reactor core, nuclear chain reaction, radioactive source or any other source of radiation, and to mitigate the consequences of such events if they were to occur. The standards apply to facilities and activities that give rise to radiation risks, including nuclear installations, the use of radiation and radioactive sources, the transport of radioactive material and the management of radioactive waste. Presented IAEA standard apply to radiation protection and safety in wide range meaning of radiation risk [1].

00362 | Westinghouse is currently updating and/or adding to the list of AP1000 compliance assessments against IAEA standards.
00363 | Structure of this document for compliance assessments
00364 | Compliance assessment introduction for Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards – part of IAEA Safety Standards for protecting people and the environment.
00365 | General Safety Requirements Part 3, No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards, provide general information about radiation and threats connected with that. It explains the need for implementing protection and safety standards, including global responsibility in this area. This document formulates requirements which shall be fulfilled for safe exploitation of radiation sources in wide range of applications. The IAEA Safety Reference reflects expected practices to be implemented in the IAEA countries and specifically focus on radiation protection and safety.
00366 | For the Safety Reference Levels [1], a line-by-line compliance assessment is performed and documented in Section 2. Section 2.1 identifies the compliance labels applied in the assessment. Section 2.2 – 2.5 contain a compliance assessment with identification of the conformity and provides a short justification using the basis for compliance assessment described in Section 1.2.
00367 | Basis for compliance assessment
00368 | The standard AP1000 plant design is the design documented in APP-GW-GL-700, Rev. 19, “AP1000 Plant Design Control Document” [7], herein referred to the as the Design Control Document (DCD). This standard AP1000 plant design is used as the basis for the compliance assessment as it provides one consistent reference document with sufficient information to demonstrate the safety approach for the AP1000 plant design, analysis, and licensing basis in the United States (U.S), which is approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
00369 | The Reference Plant design for future AP1000 units is the Vogtle Unit 4 design. There are design and licensing updates for Vogtle Unit 4 that have occurred since the issuance of the DCD [7]. However, the DCD [7] provides documentation that supports the safety approach of the AP1000 plant design for the Reference Plant and future AP1000 plant designs for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with requirements related to overall design methodology, performance goals, safety analysis methodology and basis for future licensing documentation. The DCD [7] also provides a single reference document, available as a public, non-proprietary document, for supporting information for this compliance assessment.
00370 | A probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) consists of a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the risks. This exercise is referred to as ‘probabilistic risk assessment’ in the U.S. regulatory context. These two names are equivalent. The design Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) for the standard AP1000 plant is documented in APP-GW-GL-022 Rev. 8 [8]. The design PRA [8] provides a basis to demonstrate the PRA approach and methodology implemented in informing the standard AP1000 plant design. For the Reference Plant, there is a Vogtle Unit 3 & 4 specific PRA that has been developed implementing updates to the AP1000 plant design from the standard AP1000 plant design to the Vogtle Unit 4 design and site-specific aspects of the Vogtle 3 & 4 AP1000 units. The design PRA [8] is used in this compliance assessment to provide consistent documentation to the DCD [7] and because it adequately demonstrates the PRA methodology and PRA basis for the key design decisions in the overall AP1000 plant design.
00371 | There are some cases where the justification for compliance with the requirement is improved by reference to the latest Reference Plant documentation. When this is applicable, it is included in the compliance assessment.
00372 | Ap1000 plant description
00373 | Overview
00374 | The AP1000 plant is a 3400-MWth pressurized water reactor (PWR) with passive safety features and extensive plant simplifications that enhance construction, operation, maintenance, and safety. One of the key design approaches in the AP1000 plant is to use passive features to mitigate design basis accidents (DBAs). In addition to redundancy, these features incorporate diversity based on probabilistic risk assessment (PRA, also called Probabilistic Safety Assessment or PSA) insights. Active defense-in-depth (DiD) features provide investment protection, reduce the demands on the passive features and support the aggressive PRA targets.
00375 | The AP1000 plant is designed to achieve a high safety and performance record. It is conservatively based on proven PWR technology, but with an emphasis on passive safety features. Consistent with current practice, DiD systems are used as the first level of defense against more probable events. As the second level of defense, the AP1000 plant uses passive safety systems to further enhance plant safety and to satisfy utility requirements (e.g., EUR and Electric Power Research Institute [EPRI] Utility Requirements Document [URD]). Safety systems use natural driving forces such as pressurized gas, gravity flow, natural circulation flow, and convection. Safety systems do not use active components (such as pumps, fans or diesel generators) and are designed to function without safety-grade support systems (such as alternating current [AC] power; component cooling water; service water; and heating, ventilating and air conditioning [HVAC]). The number and complexity of operator actions required to control the safety systems are minimized; the approach is to eliminate operator action rather than automate it.
00376 | The AP1000 plant design provides adequate protection of public health and safety with respect to radiation sources. The AP1000 design follows ALARA (As-Low-As-Reasonably Achievable) policy. Provisions and designs for maintaining personnel exposures ALARA are presented in the following paragraphs:
00377 | Design structures, systems and components for reliability and maintainability, thereby effectively reducing the maintenance requirements on radioactive components,
00378 | Design structures, systems and components to reduce the radiation fields, thereby allowing operation, maintenance and inspection activities to be performed in the minimum design radiation field,
00379 | Design structures, systems and components to reduce access, repair and removal times, thereby effectively reducing the time spent in radiation fields during operation, maintenance, and inspection,
00380 | Design structures, systems and components to accommodate remote and semi-remote operation, maintenance and inspection, thereby effectively reducing the time spent in radiation fields.
00381 | Facility Design Features for radiation protection
00382 | Chapter 12, subsection 12.3.1. of the Design Control Document (DCD) describes specific design features for maintaining personnel exposure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). The referenced section contains explanation of each of the features implemented for protection from harmful effects of ionizing radiation.
00383 | Shielding from radiation effects
00384 | The objective of the plant radiation shielding is to minimize personnel and population exposures, while maintaining a program of controlled personnel access to and occupancy of radiation areas. Radiation levels are within the requirements of 10 CFR 50 during design basis accidents and ALARA within the requirements of 10 CFR 20 during normal operation. Shielding and equipment layout and design are considered in providing confidence that exposures are kept ALARA during anticipated personnel activities in areas of the plant containing radioactive materials. The nuclear radiation shielding is designed to provide personnel protection and is based on the following operating states:
00385 | Normal, full-power operation,
00386 | Shutdown operation,
00387 | Spent resin transfer,
00388 | Emergency operations (for required access to safety-related equipment).
00389 | The shielding design objectives for the plant during these operating states are:
00390 | Ensure radiation exposure to plant operating personnel, contractors, administrators, visitors, and site boundary occupants is ALARA and within the limits of 10 CFR 20,
00391 | Provide sufficient personnel access and occupancy time to allow normal anticipated maintenance, inspection, and safety-related operations required for each plant equipment and instrumentation area,
00392 | Reduce potential equipment neutron activation and mitigate the effects of radiation on materials,
00393 | Provide sufficient shielding for the control room so that for design basis accidents (DBAs) the direct dose plus the inhalation dose (calculated in Chapter 15) does not exceed the limits of 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General Design Criterion 19.
00394 | Shielding is provided to attenuate direct radiation through walls and penetrations and scattered radiation to less than the upper limit of the radiation zone for each area shown in Figure 12.3.-1. of the DCD prepared for the AP1000 plant. Materials used in shielding typically include lead, steel, water, and concrete. The material used for most of the plant shielding is ordinary concrete with a bulk density of approximately 2243 kg/m3 (140 lb/ft3). Whenever poured-in-place concrete has been replaced by concrete blocks, an equivalent shielding basis as determined by the density of the concrete block is selected. Steel is used as shielding in the chemical and volume control system and other modules, as well as around the reactor vessel flange at the floor of the refueling cavity. Water is used as the primary shield material for areas above the spent fuel storage area and refueling cavity during refueling operations. General shielding design may be found in subsection 12.3.2 of the DCD. The referenced section contains explanation of shielding features of the AP1000 design with division for specific areas of the plant.
00395 | Ventilation
00396 | The plant heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems are designed to provide a suitable environment for personnel and equipment during normal operation. The system is designed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 20 and 10 CFR 50. Design criteria for the plant HVAC systems include the following:
00397 | During normal operation the average and maximum airborne radioactivity levels to which plant personnel are exposed in restricted areas of the plant are ALARA and within the limits specified in 10 CFR 20. The average and maximum airborne radioactivity levels in unrestricted areas of the plant during normal operation, are ALARA and within the limits of 10 CFR 20.
00398 | During normal operations the dose from concentrations of airborne radioactive material in unrestricted areas beyond the site boundary is ALARA and within the limits specified in 10 CFR 20 and 10 CFR 50, Appendix I.
00399 | To accomplish the design objectives and minimize the spread of airborne radioactive contamination AP1000 has implemented relevant design features. These design features are described in Chapter 12, subsection 12.3.3 of the DCD.
00400 | Discussion of Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standard in AP1000 Standard Design and Reference Plant
00401 | The AP1000 plant is designed with administrative programs and procedures to maximize the incorporation of good engineering practices and lessons learned to accomplish As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) objectives as described in DCD [7] Chapter 12. The ALARA philosophy is applied in the AP1000 plant design. The design is reviewed for ALARA considerations and updated and modified as experience from operating plants is applied. ALARA reviews include the plant design and integrated layout, considering shielding, ventilation, and monitoring instrument designs as they relate to traffic control, security, access control, and health physics.
00402 | Similarly, routing of pipe containing radioactive fluids is reviewed as part of the design effort. This confirms that lines expected to contain significant radiation sources are adequately shielded and properly routed to minimize exposure of personnel.
00403 | Many of the engineers and supervisors assigned to the AP1000 design have performed similar design work or service work on other nuclear power plants. Through this experience, they have acquired knowledge of the radiation protection aspects which are applied to the AP1000 design. Nuclear plant operating experience is incorporated through Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inspection and enforcement bulletins, information notices, and other documents. Independent reviews are conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Utility Steering Committee and its subcommittees. Knowledge of radiation protection and ALARA is applied to the AP1000 design. This allows integration of experience and ALARA considerations from plant operators and plant designers and promotes incorporation of recent operating and service experience and lessons learned.
00404 | Radiation Protection Design Features are described in DCD [7] subsection 12.1.3. This section includes the figures of AP1000 Radiation Zones on Normal Operation, Shutdown, and in Post Accident Conditions. The radiation analyses used to develop the AP1000 plant radiation zoning significantly affect the outcome shown in the DCD and the overall plant zoning. Westinghouse analyses performed for the U.S. contain a conservative bias (assuming such situations as 0.25 percent fuel defects), and are not consistent with typical operating conditions, expected radiation fields, or operating experience from existing plants. This conservative methodology is used to bound a variety of operating conditions. However more realistic methodologies are used in other jurisdictions.
00405 | The AP1000 was designed attending the US-NRC regulatory framework. This regulatory framework is mainly collected in the following: Title 10, Part 20, of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR Part 20), "Standards for Protection Against Radiation"; 10 CFR Part 50, "Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities"; and Appendix I to 10 CFR Part 50, "Numerical Guides for Design Objectives and Limiting Conditions for Operation to Meet the Criterion 'As Low as is Reasonably Achievable' for Radioactive Material in Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor Effluents."
00406 | In relation to Assuring that Occupational Radiation Exposures Are As-Low-As-Reasonably Achievable in AP1000 design:
00407 | AP1000 design compliance with 10 CFR 20 is confirmed for the design and operation of the facility following the guidelines of Regulatory Guides 1.8, 8.8, and 8.10. Compliance with Regulatory Guides is addressed as discussed in DCD [7] subsection 12.1.3 The design of AP1000 meets the guidelines of Regulatory Guide 8.8, Sections C.2 and C.4, which address facility, equipment, and instrumentation design features. Features of the plant that are examples of compliance with Regulatory Guide 8.8 are delineated in Section 12.3.
00408 | As explained in DCD [7] subsection 12.1.3 the operational considerations of ALARA, as well as the related policies, programs and operational procedures that grant compliance with occupational exposure are to be addressed under the responsibility of the Licensee (the Nuclear Power Plant Operator), this includes the operational considerations included in Standard Review Plan (NUREG-0800), Regulatory Guides that will be addressed include: 8.2, 8.7, 8.9, 8.13, 8.15, 8.20, 8.25, 8.26, 8.27, 8.28, 8.29, 8.34, 8.35, 8.36, and 8.38.
00409 | It must be noted that NRC Regulation on Radiation Protection has not been updated to the ICRP Publication 103, reference [9], see attachment included to this assessment with a more detailed explanation. However, the US-NRC believes that NRC's current regulatory framework continues to adequately protect the health and safety of nuclear industry workers, the public, and the environment.
00410 | The AP1000 Standard Design contained in the DCD [7] and Vogtle Reference plant for Bulgaria Project Licensing Basis are based on this US-NRC Regulatory Framework. However, this will not be considered as Non-Compliance for the project, since the extensive use of ALARA considerations in the Design, and existing analysis, shows that the reduction of some limits is achievable with the current design once Operational Radiation Programs are set in place.
00411 | As an example:
00412 | NRC’s current 10CFR20.1201 sets Occupational dose limits total effective dose equivalent for adults to 50 mSv (5 rem), and at the same time sets current requirements for ALARA which appear inside 10 CFR20 subsection related to Radiation Protection Programs 10 CFR 20.1101(b) and 10 CFR 20.1101(d). This is higher than current 20 mSv limit in references [1],[9],[10]. However, it needs to be stated that given previous ALARA considerations, the United States (and western European Countries, with the same type of reactors) have been successful in reducing individual exposures so that only a very limited number of individuals exceeded 20 mSv (2 rem) in a year. Nevertheless, this will be dealt conservatively as a Compliance for the projects at which it is required, in this case some specific calculation would be needed to reconcile with such limits. Also, as in AP1000 “Compliance Assessment of the AP1000 Plant to EUR Revision E Key Issues” reference [11], it is explained that individual dose for the AP1000 plant would meet the target for individual effective dose of 5 mSv/year.
00413 | All the previous is backed-up by NUREG‐0173, an available source of historical dose data; its application to the AP1000 plant is documented in AP1000 ALARA Guidelines Manual, reference [12].
00414 | Also, in the case of occupational exposure of the eye lens, the lowered limit of 20 mSv applied differs. This has been object of study since limits on effective dose could have been insufficient to match this requirement however:
00415 | Radiation protection services in nuclear power plants tend to shield the sources rather than the individuals to protect the workers, (e.g. is not usual to use protective lead aprons). In this way the radiation fields to which workers are exposed, in most situations, are uniform, both for the lens and the whole body and therefore, the dosimeter placed in the chest would provide a good estimate of both the effective dose and the dose equivalent to the lens.
00416 | The dosimetric magnitudes Hp(10) and/or Hp(0.07) are adequate to control the dose to the lens, Hp(3).
00417 | The source term of Nuclear Power Plants is composed mainly of low energy beta emitters (<0.7 MeV), these emissions have low impact on the dose to the lens.
00418 | Activities considered at risk by the IAEA for irradiation to the lens are not carried out in the plants in operation. This aspect is not expected to be modified at least until the dismantling work, where additional precautions might be needed. The working practices and protective equipment used in nuclear power plants in operation (eye protection goggles and in highly contaminated areas respiratory protection equipment) ensure attenuation of high energy beta particles.
00419 | Dosimetric records indicate that the operational doses received in industry are low enough that, together with the measures already adopted by the Nuclear Sector within the framework of industrial regulations relating to risk prevention and protection measures against environmental pollution commonly used in installations, allow the new lens dose limit not to be compromised.
00420 | The collective annual doses have been calculated in APP‐SSAR‐GSC‐565 [13]. These have been updated since the values presented in DCD Chapter 12. The collective annual doses demonstrate that the AP1000 plant design meets the collective dose target of 0.5 man Sv/year per unit.
00421 | Also, some differences in the regulation exist regarding public exposure; not with the Dose Limit which in both cases is set to 1 mSv effective dose, but in other areas such as the dose limits for the lens of the eye.
00422 | Compliance Assessment Summary of Results
00423 | The AP1000 plant design meets all design related IEA General Safety Requirement Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources issues, since identified potential risks are not considered as non-compliant. This has been explained in sections 1.4 and 1.7 of this document. Part of the requirements do not apply to the nuclear power plants (not applicable to the technology) and they are not considered. Part of the requirements is related to establishing rules, regulations and good practices that are primarily the work of the Government / Regulatory body. A large part of the requirements is related to operation of the technology that includes nuclear power plants and responsibility belong to the Owner / Licensee. Only a few of the requirements are related to the design of the AP1000 and these points contain relevant description. It is worth noting that Westinghouse is taking prime responsibility for safety during design development, which includes taking care of protection from harmful effects of ionizing radiation.
00424 | The purpose of this task during Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) is the identification of potential design risks and priorities for assessment work to be performed in a future project phase.
00425 | The High Level Risk Assessment of this standard is found in sections 1.6 and 1.7 of this document, attending to the compliance statements in section 2 of this document. The following risk categories are assigned:
00426 | Low risk: Compliance with regulation, codes, and standards is expected to be demonstrated without requiring a design change or requiring new design analyses.
00427 | Medium risk: Compliance with regulation, codes, and standards is expected to be demonstrated without requiring a design change but requiring new design analyses.
00428 | High risk: Compliance with regulation, codes, and standards is expected to require a design change and potentially new design analyses.
00429 | The category assigned to each regulation, code or standard will be justified, and any identified gaps will
00430 | be discussed.
00431 | Table 1-1 provides a summary of the AP1000 plant compliance assessment to the IAEA General Safety Requirements on Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources. The compliance categories are defined in Section 2.1. The detailed justification of compliance is provided in the identified Sections 2.2 – 2.5.

Nevertheless Westinghouse is confident that the AP1000 plant can meet the dose limits provided in this standard by performing additional calculations based on appropriate assumptions. Thus conservatively, these are considered as CWO since at some point there could be potentially the need to make additional analyses.

00717 | Conclusions
00718 | Given the analyses performed in Section 2, the IAEA Safety Standards No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards is classified as Medium Risk since compliance with regulation is expected to be demonstrated but will require some additional analysis. In particular Medium Risk Classification is based on the topics described in Subsection 1.7.
00719 | These topics are related to:
00720 | Differences in framework between IAEA and the United States (NRC). These differences are analyzed more detailed in subsection 1.4 and 1.7 of this report, and might in some specific cases require some additional analyses, but are not expected to lead to any major design changes,
00721 | Some minor design changes might be requested for some plant and effluent monitors, however since they are considered as minor, we maintain the classification as medium risk.
00722 | The AP1000 plant is designed with administrative programs and procedures to maximize the incorporation of good engineering practices and lessons learned to accomplish ALARA objectives. This has been reviewed and verified by US-NRC Reviews of Standard Design Certification, the beginning of the Operation at Vogtle Unit 3, China Operating Plants, as well as by the Generic Design Assessment in the United Kingdom (UK).
00723 | Thus, the AP1000 design should be able to accommodate the IAEA Standard, with some specific dose analyses that need to be performed for compliance, and some minor changes in some radiation and effluent monitors.
00724 | Identified Potential Risks To Be Addressed
00725 | The analyses of section 2 show that the following requirement and sub-requirements need to be considered in the risk assessment:
00726 | Requirements related to different expected Occupational dose as explained in subsection 1.4:
00727 | Requirement 1: Application of the principles of radiation protection,
00728 | Requirement 12: Dose limits,
00729 | Requirement 19: Responsibilities of the regulatory body specific to occupational exposure
00730 | Requirement 21: Responsibilities of employers, registrants and licensees for protection of workers.
00731 | Compliance with dose limits and dose constraints for occupationally exposed workers and members of the public has to be demonstrated. As explained in subsection 1.4 of this assessment, the current AP1000 design is capable of fulfilling this requirement with appropriate radiation programs in place, even though these limits differ from the ones used in 10 CFR 20. Thus conservatively, this is considered as CWO since at some point there could be potentially the need to make additional analyses.
00732 | Other requirements based on differences between US-NRC radiation protection regulatory framework and IAEA for Radiation Protection:
00733 | Requirement 29: Responsibilities of the government and the regulatory body specific to public exposure,
00734 | Requirement 30: Responsibilities of relevant parties specific to public exposure,
00735 | Requirement 44: Preparedness and response for an emergency.
00736 | Realistic assessment of the doses to members of the public and for comparison with dose constraints due to releases has to be done. A specific calculation will be needed for releases in normal operation and emergency conditions, even though some feasibility studies of compliance were performed previously.
00737 | Compliance assessment for IAEA Safety Reference levels
00738 | This section provides the detailed assessment of the standard AP1000 plant design described in Section 1.2. Compliance is assessed by the compliance assessment classifications identified in 2.1 and a justification is provided to support the compliance assessment.

00772 | Description
00773 | Compliance
00774 | Justification
00775 | Parties with responsibilities for protection and safety shall ensure that the principles of radiation protection are applied for all exposure situations.
00776 | COM, OR, EP
00777 | Westinghouse has conducted the AP1000 design development under its recognized Quality Management System (QMS) and has taken prime responsibility for safety during the design development. A primary objective for the AP1000 design is to achieve a very low risk of harm to people and the environment. The AP1000 design includes measures to reduce risk to people and the environment over the phases of the plant lifecycle. These measures are discussed in the DCD. DCD Chapter 2 discusses siting aspects. DCD chapters 3 through 10 discuss design, manufacturing and construction aspects. DCD Chapter 11 discusses radioactive waste management aspects. DCD Chapter 12 discusses radiation protection. DCD Chapter 14 discusses commissioning aspects. DCD Chapter 15 discusses Accident Analyses, DCD Chapter 18 discusses Human Factors Engineering and DCD Chapter 19 discusses Probabilistic Risk Assessment.
00778 | The as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) policy is applied during the design of the AP1000 plant to minimize occupational and public radiological effects. The design is reviewed as per ALARA considerations and updated based on experience from existing operating plants. ALARA reviews include the plant design and integrated layout, considering shielding, HVAC, and monitoring instrument designs as they relate to traffic control, security, access control and health physics. DCD Chapter 12 further discusses the application of ALARA principles in the design of the AP1000 plant.
00779 | Also, DCD chapter 13 provides information about conduct of operation, which describes operation in normal, abnormal and emergency conditions.
00780 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee and/or external parties.
00781 | 2.8.
00782 | For planned exposure situations, each party with responsibilities for protection and safety shall ensure, when relevant requirements apply to that party, that no practice is undertaken unless it is justified.

00785 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee and/or other external parties.
00786 | 2.9.
00787 | For emergency exposure situations and existing exposure situations, each party with responsibilities for protection and safety shall ensure, when relevant

00793 | COM, OR, EP
00794 | AP1000 design complies with 10 CFR 20, and Regulatory Guides 1.8, 8.8, and 8.10. These guidelines outline the practices of as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) for nuclear power plants. The ALARA policy is applied to minimize occupational and public radiological effects. The design is reviewed for ALARA considerations and updated as experience from operating plants is applied. ALARA reviews include the plant design and integrated layout, considering shielding, HVAC, and monitoring instrument designs as they relate to traffic control, security, access control and health physics. DCD Chapter 12 further discusses the application of ALARA principles in the design of the AP1000 plant and by following ALARA policy confirms that radiation protection and safety is optimized.
00795 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee and/or other external parties.
00796 | 2.11.
00797 | For planned exposure situations other than for medical exposure, each party with responsibilities for protection and safety shall ensure that, when relevant requirements apply to that party, specified dose limits are not exceeded.
00798 | CWO, OR, EP
00799 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee and/or other external parties.
00800 | As explained in section 1.4 of this assessment, current AP1000 design is capable of fulfilling this requirement with appropriate radiation programs in place, even though these limits differ to the ones used in 10 CFR 20. Some differences in the standard are present in relation with the public exposure, not with the Dose Limit which in both cases is set to 1 mSv effective dose, such as the dose limits for the lens of the eye. Nevertheless Westinghouse is confident that the AP1000 plant can meet the dose limits provided in this standard by performing additional calculations based on appropriate assumptions. Thus conservatively, these are considered as CWO since at some point there could be potentially the need to make additional analyses.
00801 | 2.12.
00802 | The application of the requirements for the system of protection and safety shall be commensurate with the radiation risks associated with the exposure situation.
00803 | COM, OR, EP
00804 | Westinghouse recognizes the radiation risks associated with its own technology and has established commensurate system of protection with relevant radiation protection features in the design. AP1000 design pursues the radiation protection principle of optimization. The design complies with 10 CFR 20, and Regulatory Guides 1.8, 8.8, and 8.10. These guidelines outline the practices of as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) for nuclear power plants. The ALARA policy is applied to minimize occupational and public radiological effects.

01385 | OR, EP
01386 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee and/or external party.
01387 | The radiation monitoring system plus the portable equipment is sufficient to monitor the relevant radiological parameters.
01388 | The Radiation Monitoring System (RMS) is grouped into four categories:
01389 | Process Monitors (liquid and gaseous),
01390 | Effluent Monitors (liquid and gaseous),
01391 | Airborne Monitors,
01392 | Area Monitors.
01393 | Process Monitors monitor systems processes. Ventilation streams and effluent paths are monitored by radiation monitors distributed throughout the plant. The radiation monitors consist of detectors, instruments, process sampling and conditioning skids, Local Radiation Processors, and associated components, as applicable.
01394 | Effluent monitors measure the gaseous and liquid discharges.
01395 | Airborne Monitors measure the airborne radioactivity and monitor and alert operating personnel to airborne radioactivity concentrations in excess of 10 DAC (Derived air concentration)-hours (as defined in 10 CFR 20). Certain of these monitors also perform process monitor functions, in that they initiate filtration of the ventilation stream.
01396 | The area radiation monitors are provided to supplement the personnel and area radiation survey provisions of the health physics program and to comply with the personnel radiation protection guidelines of 10 CFR 20, 10 CFR 50, and 10 CFR 70 (Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear Material) and Regulatory Guides 1.97 (Criteria for Accident Monitoring Instrumentation for Nuclear Power Plant) and 8.8 (Information Relevant to Ensuring that Occupational Radiation Exposures at Nuclear Power Stations Will Be as Low as Is Reasonably Achievable). During fuel handling operations in containment and the fuel handling area, criticality monitoring functions are performed by area radiation monitors in combination with portable monitors, as required by the guidelines of 10 CFR 70.24.
01397 | Area monitors provide protection for plant personnel. Detectors are located so that their readouts are representative of the radiation to which the operating personnel would be exposed and local readout/alarm modules are located so that they are easily visible to the operating personnel.
01398 | Area monitors have identical alarm, display, and data storage capabilities as described for the process monitors. Area monitors have two distinct audible and visual alarms, initiated when a predetermined setpoint is exceeded on high radiation levels, which are located near the detector or in an area where the local visual alarm can be seen upon entry into the monitored area. Indication and alarms are also provided in the Main Control Room (MCR).

01414 | The AP1000 plant has been designed to a robust, comprehensive set of design codes and standards. The vast majority of these design codes have originated in the U.S. and are an accepted international best practice. The DCD defines the nuclear codes and standards implemented for the standard AP1000 plant design. The codes identified are primarily internationally accepted nuclear specific standards that have been developed and refined over the decades of advancements of nuclear technology in the U.S. and other countries. These include such standards as Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code for mechanical components and pressure vessels and American Concrete Institute (ACI 349) for concrete structures and systems, and American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) N690 for the design of safety‐related concrete and steel structures. For electrical, I&C, and human factors design, the plant design has primarily followed Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) or U.S. NRC‐developed guidance. Such standards serve as the basis for Westinghouse nuclear power plant designs delivered throughout the world. An international supply chain is capable of designing and manufacturing equipment and materials in accordance with these standards. The worldwide acceptance of these standards supports the Westinghouse goal to maximize localization to the extent possible. These standards are widely understood and accepted by nuclear regulators.
01415 | The following sections of the DCD provide additional information on applicable codes and standards:
01416 | DCD Sections 1.2.1.6 and 3.7.2 – codes and standards for structures,
01417 | DCD Section 1.9 – compliance with U.S. NRC Regulatory Criteria,
01418 | DCD Section 3.1 – compliance with 10 CFR 50,
01419 | Appendix A,
01420 | DCD Table 3.2‐3 – principal construction codes for mechanical and fluid system components,
01421 | DCD Section 7.1.4 – codes and standards for I&C systems,
01422 | DCD Section 8.1.4.3 – codes and standards for electrical systems.
01423 | The AP1000 follows applicable codes and standards for siting, design, construction, and assembly.
01424 | Westinghouse has conducted the AP1000 design development under its recognized QMS and has taken prime responsibility for safety during the design development. The AP1000 plant is designed with administrative programs and procedures to maximize the incorporation of good engineering practices. A primary objective for the AP1000 design is to achieve a very low risk of harm to people and the environment. The AP1000 design includes measures to reduce risk to people and the environment over the phases of the plant lifecycle. These measures are discussed in the DCD.
01425 | The AP1000 provides sufficient margins to reduce probability of exposure to ionizing radiation.
01426 | The AP1000 has used relevant operating experience from the existing nuclear power plant fleet to increase safety within the plant and help mitigate potential accidents and exposure.
01427 | The Owner/Licensee or/and external parties takes the responsibility to ensure that these requirements remain fulfilled after the commissioning of the AP1000 plant.
01428 | Defence in depth
01429 | 3.40.
01430 | Registrants and licensees shall ensure that a multilevel (defence in depth) system of sequential, independent provisions for protection and safety that is commensurate with the likelihood and magnitude of potential exposures is applied to sources for which the registrants and licensees are authorized. Registrants and licensees shall ensure that if one level of protection were to fail, the subsequent independent level of protection would be available. Such defence in depth shall be applied for the purposes of:
01431 | (a) Preventing accidents;
01432 | (b) Mitigating the consequences of any accidents that do occur;
01433 | (c) Restoring the sources to safe conditions after any such accidents.
01434 | OR
01435 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee.
01436 | The AP1000 plant design provides systems and procedures to maintain the plant in a controlled state and to prevent abnormal operation and failure. In normal operation, the most fundamental level of defense-in-depth ensures that the plant can be operated stably and reliably. This is achieved by the selection of materials, by using redundancy in key installation elements, by quality assurance during design and construction, by well-trained operators, and by an advanced control system and plant design that provide substantial margins for plant operation before approaching safety limits. The capability for mitigation of anticipated operational occurrences and design basis accidents is demonstrated in the safety analyses in DCD Chapter 15 and the summary of the PRA results presented in DCD Chapter 19.
01437 | Accident prevention
01438 | 3.41.
01439 | Registrants and licensees shall ensure that structures, systems and components, including software, that are related to protection and safety for facilities and activities are designed, constructed, commissioned, operated and maintained so as to prevent accidents as far as reasonably practicable.

As part of this emergency plan, the registrant or licensee shall include arrangements for the prompt identification of an emergency, and for determining the appropriate level of the emergency response [20]. In relation to the arrangements for the emergency response at the scene by the registrant or licensee, the emergency plan shall include, in particular:
01458 | (a) Provision for individual monitoring and area monitoring, and arrangements for medical treatment; (b) Arrangements for assessing and mitigating any consequences of an emergency.
01459 | OR
01460 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee.
01461 | The AP1000 PRA evaluation risk assessment includes calculations of the AP1000 response to severe accidents. This response includes the release of radionuclides. This analysis supports the technical basis for simplification of offsite emergency planning. The offsite emergency planning is discussed in Chapter 13 of DCD prepared for AP 1000 which may be helpful.
01462 | The area radiation monitors are provided to supplement the personnel and area radiation survey provisions of the health physics program and to comply with the personnel radiation protection guidelines of 10 CFR 20, 10 CFR 50, and 10 CFR 70 (Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear Material) and Regulatory Guides 1.97 (Criteria for Accident Monitoring Instrumentation for Nuclear Power Plant) and 8.8 (Information Relevant to Ensuring that Occupational Radiation Exposures at Nuclear Power Stations Will Be as Low as Is Reasonably Achievable).

01464 | They recognize planned, emergency, and existing exposure situations, and apply the fundamental principles of justification and optimization of protection to all of these situations. They maintain the Commission’s current individual dose limits for effective dose and equivalent dose from all regulated sources in planned exposure situations. They reinforce the principle of optimization of protection, which should be applicable in a
01465 | similar way to all exposure situations, subject to the following restrictions on individual doses and risks; dose and risk constraints for planned exposure situations, and reference levels for emergency and existing exposure situations.

01780 | OR, EP
01781 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee and/or other external parties.
01782 | Westinghouse may assist in establishing procedural and technical arrangements in the area of radiation protection program for occupational exposure, if requested. Chapter 12 of the DCD prepared for the AP1000 plant describes radiation protection and safety what may be helpful in that case. Subsection 12.3 outlines zoning and risk of exposure to radiation within the listed zones. It might be used as a basis for an assessment of the expected annual doses and the probability and magnitude of potential exposure. In the AP1000 plant, the following radiation zones are used:
01783 | Previous Zoning should serve to inform this requirement.
01784 | Note also the consideration made about the inherent conservativeness embedded in this zoning as explained in subsection 1.4.
01785 | Further, Westinghouse fully expects that measured dose rates within an operating AP1000 plant will be lower than the illustrated radiation zones in the DCD; and in fact, Westinghouse also expects that, with additional analysis efforts considering realistic source terms, it could be shown that many, if not almost all, of the zone limits indicated in the technical requirements are met.
01786 | Secondly, although the AP1000 plant was designed in the U.S. where a 50 mSv/a individual dose limit applies, the AP1000 plant design (including radiation zoning) facilitates compliance with annual dose standards of 20 mSv/a for trained workers without any physical design changes or requirements for extraordinary radiation protection initiatives.

02665 | 4.8.
02666 | Development of a protection strategy shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following three successive steps:
02667 | (1) A reference level expressed in terms of residual dose shall be set, typically an effective dose in the range of 20–100 mSv, that includes dose contributions via all exposure pathways. The protection strategy shall include planning for residual doses to be as low as reasonably achievable below the reference level, and the strategy shall be optimized.
02668 | (2) On the basis of the outcome of the optimization of the protection strategy, using the reference level, generic criteria for particular protective actions and other response actions, expressed in terms of projected dose or of dose that has been received, shall be developed. If the numerical values of the generic criteria47 are exceeded, those protective actions and other response actions, either individually or in combination, shall be implemented.
02669 | (3) Once the protection strategy has been optimized and a set of generic criteria has been developed, pre-established operational criteria for initiating the different parts of an emergency plan, primarily for the initial phase, shall be derived from the generic criteria. Operational criteria, such as on-scene conditions, operational intervention levels and emergency action levels, shall be expressed in terms of parameters or observable conditions. Arrangements shall be established in advance to revise these operational criteria, as appropriate, in an emergency, with account taken of the prevailing conditions as they evolve.
02670 | CWO, EP, OR
02671 | This is the responsibility of the Owner/Licensee and/or external parties.
02672 | The provided effective doses are in Agreement with EURATOM 2013/59 [10] Annex I. Reference levels for public exposure are referred to in Articles 7 (Reference levels, in which there is a request to establish them for emergency and existing exposure situations), 101 (Establishment of strategies) and the recommendation in ICRP-103 [11] for planning of emergency Exposure Situations, see Table 8.
02673 | This will be based on Westinghouse provided information. In this respect:
02674 | Two sets of radiological consequence analyses have been performed for the AP1000 plant design. In the US, radiological consequences have historically been calculated using very conservative methodologies (where consideration of severe accidents is included as part of the design basis dose analyses), and likewise compared with specific acceptance criteria consistent with those conservative assumptions. The dose analyses presented in DCD [3] Chapter 15 were performed in this context, meeting U.S requirements. For the United Kingdom (UK) Generic Design Assessment (GDA) licensing process, dose calculations were performed using more realistic assumptions, consistent with common regulatory practice outside of the US.
02675 | The analyses applicable to the Reference Plant are those presented in DCD Chapter 15. Total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) doses calculated for US licensing include contributions from inhalation and immersion. Doses calculated at the main control room, at the site boundary or exclusion area boundary (EAB) for the limiting 2‐hour interval, and at the low population zone (LPZ) outer boundary for the duration of the accident releases. Only the adult age group is considered. In the US, the acceptance criteria for radiological releases calculated and presented in the DCD are established by 10 CFR 50.34, which requires that:
02676 | An individual at the boundary of the exclusion area for any 2‐hour period would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem (250 mSv) TEDE,
02677 | An individual at the outer boundary of the low population zone would not receive a radiation dose in excess of 25 rem (250 mSv) TEDE All events analyzed as described in DCD Chapter 15 meet the US acceptance criteria.
02678 | Note that although the NRC requirements seem to be less strict, this is not necessarily true due to the conservatisms that are included in the U.S NRC approach (mainly the requirement that the source term is based on a deterministic core melt accident, a significantly more conservative source term). The U.S NRC requires the dose assessment for LOCAs to postulate a source term consistent with full core melt, despite the safety analysis prediction of limited fuel rod failures and the maintenance of coolable geometry. The US analysis requirements, which are thus significantly more conservative, have correspondingly higher limits than in other countries in some cases; this is the reason that the DCD results would not comply with the limits prescribed in other countries, but the reason, as explained above, is simply due to the different licensing methodology and terminology used in dose analyses in the US-specific analyses.
02679 | A second set of analyses have been performed in support of licensing or pre-licensing efforts in other geographies, for example in Czech Republic or in the United Kingdom, especially during the licensing process in the United Kingdom, the UK regulator requested that Westinghouse calculate the radiological consequences of design basis faults using methods and assumptions consistent with relevant UK practice, which tend to be more realistic than U.S. methods. Dose calculations include contributions from inhalation and immersion and also from the activity deposited on the ground. Doses are calculated not only at the EAB, LPZ and in the MCR, but also to any individual onsite. Doses at all locations are calculated for the duration of releases and are reported for the adult age groups. The contribution to the doses from the activity deposited on the ground is based on a full year of exposure to the contaminated ground. These assessment calculations provide confidence that analysis might suffice to accommodate to these reference levels.
02680 | However specific calculations for accident analyses will need to be developed to fulfill IAEA Safety Standards No. GSR Part 3, Radiation Protection and Safety of Radiation Sources: International Basic Safety Standards expectations.
